This project, developed as part of the "Neuroscience of Learning Machines" course, aims to classify fruits and vegetables and determine if they are fresh or stale using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The motivation behind this project is to aid smart refrigerators and supermarkets in identifying the freshness of produce, potentially reducing food waste and ensuring better quality for consumers.
